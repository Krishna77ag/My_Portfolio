          Soft skills are character traits and interpersonal skills that
          characterize a person’s relationships with other people. In
          the workplace, soft skills are considered to be a complement to hard
          skills, which refer to a person’s knowledge and occupational skills.
          Sociologists may use the term “soft skills” to describe a
          person’s emotional intelligence quotient (EQ) as opposed to
          intelligence quotient (IQ).
